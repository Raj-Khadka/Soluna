# Soluna  

> A small experiment in calm design.  
> A timer with gentle transitions, minimal distractions, and a focus on rhythm.  

Soluna is built to feel simple. A space where you can step away from the noise for a while.  
Itâ€™s not about tracking productivity or squeezing minutes, but about marking time gently,  
with quiet motions and subtle sounds.

## ðŸŒ± Why  
Sometimes it helps to have a timer that doesnâ€™t shout, but nudges.  
Soluna is my attempt at that.
